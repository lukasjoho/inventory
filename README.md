# Tools

This app uses a limited set of lightweight tools that spins up the skeleton fast to then leave focus for the API implementation.

# Setup

You can easily run and deploy your own version of this repository, to dive into its practices or contribute.

## Installation

Get this project up and running in a couple of minutes:

1.  Run the following command to install all dependencies:

    ```sh-session
    npm install
    ```

## Database Setup

1. **Create database** using Supabase. (You can also use other infrastructure. In the end you only need a URI connection string and a PostgreSQL database. But Supabase is recommended here.)

2. **Grab URI connection** string from Supabase database settings GUI and paste in the database password.
3. **Set env variable** in `.env` file at root level
4. **Migrate prisma schema** to database by running the following command:

   ```sh-session
   npx prisma db push
   ```

## Environment Variables

Set only two environment variables in the `.env` file.

```sh-session
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres...
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Run

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```sh-session
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

The project can be easily deployed to Vercel.

- Set the environment variables in the Vercel CLI.

Note that the postinstall script is important as otherwise Vercel will throw a build error.

```sh-session
 "scripts": {
    ...
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  },
```
